Got it ‚Äî you're doing everything right, and I understand now that the problem persists **even after trying fixes**. Since we're keeping it **code-free** and strictly scoped to your architecture, here's how you should **systematically debug and resolve** this issue the right way:

---

### üß≠ Root Cause Analysis Based on Your Stack and Screenshot:

#### ‚úÖ You're inside the `Data Model Analyzer`  
- Object filters like **Standard Objects / Custom Objects** are visible  
- This means **part of the component loaded** successfully.

#### ‚ùå But the **toast/notification system** is still breaking with:
```
Cannot read properties of null (reading 'notify')
```

Which means:

1. You're calling a notification (`notify`, `toast`, etc.) somewhere in response to:
   - Successful org load
   - Filtering objects
   - Selecting relationship types
   - Something async resolving

2. The **notification function is not available** in that scope ‚Äî likely due to:
   - It not being initialized
   - Context being broken
   - You are calling a stale or undefined reference

---

### üß± Based on Your Architecture, You Should Now:

#### 1. üîç **Audit Your Toast Initialization Flow**
- Go to your **main entry point** (likely `src/main.tsx`)
- Confirm that your app is wrapped in a global provider like `<Toaster />` from `shadcn/ui` or whatever toast system you are using
- Confirm it's not conditionally rendered or missing in dev mode

#### 2. üì¶ **Trace the Toast Usage in the Component**
- Go to `DataModelAnalyzer.tsx` or wherever the error is happening
- Search for `notify`, `toast`, or anything that triggers a message when data loads or errors
- See **if it‚Äôs imported**, and from **which file**
- Also check if it‚Äôs coming from a **custom wrapper** like `lib/notify.ts`

> If you‚Äôre using a custom utility (`notify()`), it's possible the **import is broken or points to an undefined module**. That would explain the `null` reference.

#### 3. üß™ **Temporarily Disable All Notification Calls in That File**
- This is a debugging technique
- Comment out all `notify(...)`, `toast(...)`, or any variant used
- Run the page again and see if:
  - The object list loads successfully
  - The error is gone

If it disappears, then you‚Äôve 100% confirmed it‚Äôs coming from one of those toast calls.

---

### üìå Once Verified ‚Äî Reintroduce Toasts Safely

Once you know which one is causing the issue:
- Wrap it in a guard (`if (toast)`)
- Or re-import from a known working file (`@/components/ui/use-toast` if using `shadcn`)

### ‚úÖ Summary of Your Next 3 Debug Steps (No Code)

| Step | What to Do | Why |
|------|------------|-----|
| 1 | Audit `main.tsx` for toast provider | It must exist at the root |
| 2 | Search for all `notify`, `toast`, `notifyError`, etc. | One is likely undefined or broken |
| 3 | Temporarily disable all notification calls | If the error disappears, the culprit is confirmed |

Once you've verified that, I can help you decide whether to:
- Refactor the toast utility into a wrapper
- Replace `notify` with a fully controlled `toast` system

Just let me know what you find!
