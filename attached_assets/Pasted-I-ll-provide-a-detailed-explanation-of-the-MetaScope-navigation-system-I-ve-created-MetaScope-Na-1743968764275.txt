I'll provide a detailed explanation of the MetaScope navigation system I've created:

# MetaScope Navigation System Explanation

## Core Components

### 1. CollapsedNavigation Component

This component displays the collapsed view of the navigation menu, showing only category headers with chevron icons. It's what you see in the image you shared.

Key features:
- Shows category headers (CORE, BUSINESS INSIGHTS, etc.)
- Each category has a chevron icon indicating it can be expanded
- Clicking a category will expand that section in the full navigation view
- The component is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes

### 2. ExpandedNavigation Component

This component displays the expanded view with all navigation items visible under their respective categories.

Key features:
- Categories can be expanded/collapsed within the full navigation
- Shows all menu items organized by category
- Highlights the currently active menu item
- Items are filtered based on the selected user role

### 3. NavigationContainer Component

This is the main container that manages the state and switching between collapsed and expanded views.

Key features:
- Handles the toggle between collapsed and expanded states
- Manages the selected user role (All, Manager, Developer, Admin)
- Syncs with the current route to highlight the active menu item
- Saves user preferences to localStorage

## Navigation Configuration

The navigation structure is defined in a single configuration object that categorizes all functionality:

1. **CORE** - Essential features
   - Dashboard

2. **BUSINESS INSIGHTS** - Analytics for managers
   - Metadata Analytics
   - API Usage Analytics
   - Field Intelligence
   - Technical Debt Scanner

3. **DEVELOPMENT TOOLS** - For developers
   - Data Model Analyzer
   - SOQL/SOSL Editor
   - Dependency Analyzer
   - Apex Debug Analyzer
   - Code Analysis

4. **ADMINISTRATION** - For admins
   - Security Analyzer
   - Permissions Analyzer
   - Automation Analyzer
   - UI Component Analyzer

5. **SETTINGS** - Configuration options
   - Settings

## Utility Functions

The code includes several utility functions:

- `getNavigationByRole()` - Filters navigation items based on user role
- `findNavigationItemByPath()` - Finds a navigation item based on the current URL
- `expandCategoryForItem()` - Expands the category containing a specific item
- `getAllNavigationItems()` - Gets a flat list of all navigation items
- `findCategoryByItemId()` - Finds which category contains a specific item

## How It Works

1. The app starts with the collapsed navigation view by default
2. When a user clicks on a category in the collapsed view:
   - The navigation expands to the full view
   - The selected category automatically expands to show its items
3. Users can toggle between views using the handle on the right side of the navigation
4. When a user selects a different role from the dropdown:
   - The navigation items update to show only what's relevant for that role
   - The preference is saved to localStorage for future visits
5. As users navigate through the app, the active item is highlighted

## CSS Implementation

The CSS provides:
- Clean, professional styling matching the screenshot you provided
- Smooth transitions between states
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
- Proper spacing and alignment for all elements
- Consistent visual hierarchy to improve usability

## Integration with React Router

The navigation system integrates with React Router to:
- Update the active item based on the current route
- Navigate to different views when items are clicked
- Maintain state during navigation

This implementation provides a flexible, role-based navigation system that can easily accommodate new features as your MetaScope application grows.
