Perfect — you’ve spotted a critical UX alignment issue. Let's fix it cleanly and **strictly define** how it should behave from both a **UI/UX and technical perspective** so your AI devs don’t break anything that’s working.

## ✅ Feature Refactor: **“Build SOQL Query” Button in Data Model Analyzer**

### 🔧 Problem:
- **Incorrect placement:** "Build SOQL Query" is currently in **Data Model Analyzer**, which is not meant for query execution.
- **Naming inconsistency:** It says “SQL” but should say “SOQL” and “SOSL” (Salesforce-specific languages).
- **Function grouping mismatch:** Querying belongs under the **SOQL/SOSL Editor**, not the metadata visualization tool.

---

## ✅ FIX PLAN: UI + Functional Refactor

### 🧩 **1. Remove from Data Model Analyzer**
- Remove: `Build SOQL Query` button from **Object Relationship Map**
- Keep Data Model Analyzer strictly for:
  - Visualizing object and field relationships (Cytoscape.js)
  - Viewing field counts, types, and metadata
  - Navigating to object details

---

### 🪄 **2. Add to SOQL/SOSL Editor**
#### ➕ Add a new **Toggle View** switch at the top:
```
[ Editor Mode ]  |  [ Drag & Drop Builder Mode ]
```
**Default view** = Editor Mode  
- Use standard monaco or ace editor  
- Show SOQL/SOSL execution results in bottom pane  

---

### 🔄 **3. Drag-and-Drop Query Builder (New UI Panel)**
- From toggle, switch to drag & drop mode:
  - Left pane: searchable list of objects/fields
  - Right pane: “Query Canvas”
  - Users drag fields in
  - Buttons:
    - [Add Filter]
    - [Add Sort]
    - [Run Query]

✅ Must support:
- Switching between **SOQL and SOSL mode**
- Changing selected **Salesforce org context** at the top right (if multiple orgs connected)
- Basic error messages and query validation
- Displaying query results in **tabular format**

---

## ✅ STRICT FUNCTION PLACEMENT MAP

| Feature | Final Location | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| `Build SOQL Query` | **SOQL/SOSL Editor** only | Not in Data Model Analyzer |
| Toggle: Editor vs Builder | SOQL/SOSL Editor (top right) | Persist preference in local storage |
| Drag & Drop | Only inside Query Builder Mode | Use consistent design system |
| Metadata viewing | Data Model Analyzer | Object graphs, field stats, no querying |
| Field-level query shortcut | Optional: Right-click on object in Analyzer → “Query in Editor” | Opens SOQL Editor with object preloaded |

---

### 💻 Bonus Suggestion: Dev-friendly component split
You may want to separate these components to avoid regressions:
- `<SOQLQueryEditor />`
- `<SOQLQueryBuilder />`
- `<ObjectRelationshipGraph />`
- `<QueryResultsTable />`
