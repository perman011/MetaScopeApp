Perfect. This is exactly how we should be thinking — **precise, technical, testable**. You just gave a top-tier product requirement. I'm going to take **full control of this issue** now like a senior technical architect would.

## ✅ Your Business Request (Broken Down Technically)

You described 4 critical issues. Here’s a **step-by-step breakdown** that an AI agent must follow, with **clear technical plan**, **execution flow**, and **testing requirements** before handing back to you.

## 🛠️ Technical Prompt for AI Agent Developer

### 🔧 TITLE: Final Fixes for Sidebar Toggles & Enhanced Visualizer Stability

---

### ✅ Issue 1: Sidebar Toggle Buttons Not Positioned Properly

#### ❌ Problem:
- Toggle buttons are not aligned to the **top-right corner of the left sidebar**, and **top-left corner of the right panel**
- They currently float in the middle or inside scrollable areas

#### ✅ Expected:
- Left toggle button → top-right of left sidebar
- Right toggle button → top-left of right sidebar
- Toggle should stay visible at all times, not scroll with content

#### 🛠️ Dev Steps:
1. Refactor both sidebar components:
   - Place toggle buttons **outside scrollable divs**
   - Wrap them with containers using `absolute top-2 right-0` or `left-0` depending on side
2. Use Tailwind classes for placement:
   - Left toggle: `absolute top-2 -right-3 z-20`
   - Right toggle: `absolute top-2 -left-3 z-20`

### ✅ Issue 2: Toggle Opens Only Halfway (Sidebar Doesn't Fully Expand)

#### ❌ Problem:
- Clicking the toggle re-opens the panel partially — not fully visible
- Likely caused by incorrect `width` value or container still `collapsed`

#### ✅ Expected:
- On toggle:
  - Panel should fully expand to its intended width (e.g., `w-72` or `w-[300px]`)
  - Graph canvas should re-layout to use available space

#### 🛠️ Dev Steps:
1. When toggling sidebar state:
   - Set `width` using a class like `w-72` or conditional class name
2. Update layout context so graph knows it needs to resize
3. Make sure no nested divs override the panel width

### ✅ Issue 3: Toggle Button Styling (Too Big / Invisible)

#### ❌ Problem:
- Button is oversized, plain white, not visible on light backgrounds

#### ✅ Expected:
- Button should:
  - Be **small** (`w-6 h-6`)
  - Be **visible** (dark background or outlined)
  - Use **icons** like `ChevronLeft`, `ChevronRight` from `lucide-react`
  - Have hover state, rounded border, and tooltip (optional)

#### 🛠️ Dev Steps:
1. Style using Tailwind:
   - `w-6 h-6 rounded-full bg-gray-200 hover:bg-gray-300 shadow`
   - Add `text-gray-700` or contrast text
2. Use Lucide icon as inner content
3. Optionally, wrap in `Tooltip` with label like `“Collapse Panel”`

### ✅ Issue 4: Enhanced Visualizer Off → Broken Layout

#### ❌ Problem:
- When `Enhanced Visualizer` is turned off:
  - Graph nodes are jumbled, collapsed, or floating
  - Layout algorithm does not apply

#### ✅ Expected:
- When toggle is off:
  - Graph still applies **selected layout algorithm**
  - Node positioning is clean and spaced

#### 🛠️ Dev Steps:
1. In state handler for `EnhancedVisualizer` toggle:
   - Always re-run layout on toggle change:
     ```ts
     useEffect(() => {
       if (cy && layoutAlgorithm) {
         cy.layout({ name: layoutAlgorithm }).run();
       }
     }, [enhancedVisualizer, layoutAlgorithm])
     ```
2. Ensure all layouts are registered (`grid`, `circle`, `breadthfirst`, etc.)
3. Do not override layout config when `EnhancedVisualizer` is disabled

## ✅ Testing Plan (Must Be Completed Before Handoff)

| Test Case | Expected Behavior |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Left toggle collapsed | Graph area expands fully, toggle floats on edge |
| Left toggle expanded | Panel opens fully with all controls visible |
| Right toggle collapsed | Graph area expands, detail panel hidden |
| Right toggle expanded | Field and relationship details visible |
| Toggle button visibility | Buttons visible on all background themes |
| Enhanced Visualizer ON | Graph renders styled nodes with enhanced visuals |
| Enhanced Visualizer OFF | Graph still respects layout algorithm with no overlaps or broken edges |

---

## ✅ Done When:
- [ ] Toggles are positioned top-left/right of respective sidebars
- [ ] Toggle expands/collapses sidebars **fully**
- [ ] Toggle button is small, styled, and accessible
- [ ] Graph layout works 100% when Enhanced Visualizer is OFF
- [ ] All test cases pass visually and interactively
