Absolutely â€” here's the **philosophy and step-by-step explanation** behind how to fix the `notify` crash in your `Data Model Analyzer` tab **without code**:

---

### ðŸ§  What's Happening?

Your component is trying to **show a notification (e.g. toast message)** after loading org data.  
But the function or object itâ€™s trying to call (`notify`) doesn't exist â€” it's `null` or `undefined`. Thatâ€™s why youâ€™re seeing:

> `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'notify')`

---

### ðŸªœ What You Need to Do

#### 1. **Find the Source of `notify`**
Go to the part of the component or module where you're trying to show a notification â€” like:

- When org data loads successfully
- When loading fails
- When a user action is performed

Check if youâ€™re referencing a `notify` function or utility. It might be:
- A custom function you defined (e.g. `notify("Org loaded!")`)
- A 3rd-party toast library like `react-toastify`, `sonner`, or `shadcn/ui` toasts

---

#### 2. **Ensure Itâ€™s Properly Defined**
If itâ€™s a custom function, make sure itâ€™s:
- Defined in that file or imported correctly
- Not being used before initialization (like inside `useEffect` with stale closures)

If itâ€™s from a library (e.g. `toast("...")`), you need to:
- Import the toast function properly
- Make sure the toast container/provider is included at the app root level so the context works

---

#### 3. **Guard Against Null**
Even if youâ€™re pretty sure `notify` should exist, **always add a fallback check**:
- Only call it if it's available
- Or provide a default behavior (e.g. console log instead of crashing)

This protects your UI from blowing up if some async flow breaks the context.

---

#### 4. **Check Your Vite Plugin Config**
Sometimes, these `runtime-error-plugin` overlays can come from **Vite hot module reload** behavior during dev. If this only happens during development, you might also:
- Check for errors in your `vite.config.js` plugins
- Temporarily disable the HMR overlay (not recommended for production!)

---

### ðŸ’¡ Summary

> You're calling `.notify()` during org data load.  
> That function doesn't exist in that context, so it crashes.  
> Make sure it's imported, initialized, and only called if it's defined.

Would you like help identifying which library your current `notify` is tied to (like `toast`, `notyf`, `shadcn`, etc.)?
