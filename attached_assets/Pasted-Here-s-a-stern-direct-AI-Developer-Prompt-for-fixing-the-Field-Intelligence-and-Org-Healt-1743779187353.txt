Here's a **stern, direct AI Developer Prompt** for fixing the **Field Intelligence** and **Org Health Score** components exactly as required — no creativity, no substitutions.

## 🚨 AI DEVELOPER PROMPT: Critical Fixes for Field Intelligence & Org Health Components

---

### 🧱 Component 1: `FieldIntelligencePanel`

---

### 🚫 Problem #1: "All Objects" dropdown is NOT populating

#### ✅ REQUIRED BEHAVIOR:

- The **dropdown labeled `All Objects`** must populate dynamically with **all objects returned from the org metadata**, including custom and standard objects.
- Use the same data source already available in `Graph View` or `Data Model Analyzer`.
- The dropdown must:
  - Include a searchable select menu using `shadcn/ui` or equivalent.
  - Filter all field metrics below based on the selected object.

✅ **EXAMPLE:**

```
- Account
- Contact
- Opportunity
- Custom_Object__c
```

🛑 **DO NOT hardcode**, mock, or ignore empty states. If no metadata loads, show an error or loading state.

---

### 🚫 Problem #2: Total Fields, Unused Fields, Naming Issues show zero

#### ✅ REQUIRED BEHAVIOR:

- These KPIs must calculate **live metrics** based on:
  - Total number of fields for selected object (or all).
  - Count of fields with no tracked usage in the last 90 days = **Unused Fields**.
  - Count of fields that **violate naming patterns** (e.g., field name includes spaces, starts with lowercase) = **Naming Issues**.

🛑 DO NOT leave these blank or default to `0`. If data is unavailable, show `N/A`.

---

### 🔎 Problem #3: Field Usage & Field Types charts are BLANK

#### ✅ REQUIRED BEHAVIOR:

- Populate `Field Usage` as a **horizontal bar chart** showing usage frequency buckets:
  ```
  0% used | <10% used | <50% used | >50% used
  ```

- Populate `Field Types` as a **pie or donut chart** using real metadata type breakdown:
  ```
  % of Text, Picklist, Lookup, Number, etc.
  ```

🛑 DO NOT leave charts blank if metadata exists. If empty, show placeholder "No field data available".

---

### 🧱 Component 2: `OrgHealthPanel`

---

### 🚫 Problem: Score Breakdown lines have no % color logic

#### ✅ REQUIRED BEHAVIOR:

- Each category (Security, Data Model, Automation Logic, etc.) must show:
  - **Color-coded progress bars** based on score:
    - ✅ Green: `90–100`
    - ⚠️ Yellow: `70–89`
    - 🔴 Red: `<70`

- All score bars should animate in or load visibly from left to right.

🛑 DO NOT render the bars as grey. DO NOT skip color logic.

---

### 💬 Final Notes

> This prompt must be followed **exactly**.  
> No alternate UI interpretations.  
> Do not invent fallback logic.  
> This is production-critical behavior.  

**If data is unavailable, show loading or clear "No data available" states, not zero defaults.**
