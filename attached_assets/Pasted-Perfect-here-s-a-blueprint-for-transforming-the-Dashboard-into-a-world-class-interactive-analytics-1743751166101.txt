Perfect — here’s a blueprint for transforming the Dashboard into a world-class interactive analytics hub that makes MetaScope even more sellable, insightful, and delightful for daily users:

⸻

Redesigned Dashboard Vision

Purpose: One-stop hub for actionable insights across the org — interactive, visual, filterable.

⸻

Top-Level Tabs in Dashboard
	1.	Org Health (default subtab)
	•	Score breakdown (Configuration, Automation, Security, UI, Data Quality)
	•	Trend over time
	•	Top recommended actions
	•	Risk zones by type
	•	CTA: “Launch Health Copilot”
	2.	API Usage (new)
	•	Top API consumers (user/app/endpoint)
	•	Daily/weekly API volume and limits
	•	Error types + frequency
	•	Filter: Date range, user, app
	•	CTA: “Create API guardrails”
	3.	Object Insights
	•	Top 10 most used objects (by record count, automation triggers, SOQL frequency)
	•	Least used objects
	•	Click to drill down: Open related metadata
	•	CTA: “Open Object Cleanup”
	4.	Field Intelligence (new)
	•	High-impact unused fields
	•	Fields most commonly filtered on
	•	Longest tooltips or labels
	•	Fields with inconsistent naming
	•	CTA: “Launch Field Cleanup”
	5.	Automation Summary
	•	Most triggered flows, workflows
	•	Overlapping automation map
	•	Execution failures
	•	CTA: “Optimize Automations”
	6.	User Activity Heatmap (NEW)*
	•	Most active users (by API, login, metadata change)
	•	Inactive users with edit access
	•	CTA: “Audit Permissions”
	7.	Security Pulse
	•	Permission sets with high exposure
	•	Profiles with broad FLS
	•	Users with excessive access
	•	CTA: “Review Security Analyzer”
	8.	Release Tracker / Change Log
	•	Recent metadata changes
	•	Recent deployments
	•	Snapshot diffs
	•	CTA: “Compare to Previous Snapshot”

⸻

Design Principles
	•	Use Recharts or D3 for interactive visuals
	•	Embed filter panels: date range, user, object
	•	Visuals: radar, bar, pie, donut, and heatmaps
	•	Use Framer Motion for modern animations
	•	Tabs/cards powered by React Query, styled with shadcn/ui
	•	Place CTAs on every tab to drive them to deeper analyzers

Next Steps

Want me to create the technical doc and AI prompts for implementing this new Dashboard structure with the 8 tabs? I’ll assign each tab to a React route + backend endpoint. Just say the word.
