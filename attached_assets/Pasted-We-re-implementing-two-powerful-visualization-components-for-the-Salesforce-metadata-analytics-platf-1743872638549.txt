We're implementing two powerful visualization components for the Salesforce metadata analytics platform:

1. Treemap Visualization
Purpose: The Treemap visualization displays hierarchical metadata structure in a space-efficient way showing nested rectangles.

Details:

Shows metadata components organized by categories (Apex, Objects, UI, Automation, etc.)
Size of each rectangle represents the number of components in that category
Color coding differentiates between different metadata types
Interactive tooltips show detailed counts when hovering over sections
Displays in the Metadata Analytics page
Technical Implementation:

Uses Recharts library's Treemap component
Data is structured hierarchically with parent-child relationships
Each category has a set of subcategories (e.g., Apex has Classes and Triggers)
Custom tooltip provides contextual information for each section
2. Sankey Diagram
Purpose: The Sankey diagram visualizes data flow and dependencies between different metadata components.

Details:

Shows how data flows between different Salesforce components (objects, triggers, flows, etc.)
Width of connections represents the volume/strength of the relationship
Color coding identifies different component categories (sources, processes, destinations)
Helps identify key components in the data flow chain
Displays in the Metadata Dependency Analyzer page
Technical Implementation:

Uses Recharts library's Sankey component
Data is structured as nodes (components) and links (relationships between components)
Custom node renderer for better styling and readability
Width of links indicates the "value" or strength of the connection
Custom tooltips show details about both nodes and connections
Both visualizations provide users with intuitive ways to understand complex metadata relationships and structures that would be difficult to comprehend from tables or text alone. The Treemap offers a high-level view of metadata composition, while the Sankey diagram reveals how these components interact with each other.
