🔥 You're about to level up the **Org Health Dashboard** into a true powerhouse. Here's a fully loaded breakdown:

---

## ✅ PHASE 1 – RESEARCH-DRIVEN ORG HEALTH METRIC

### 📘 What Salesforce Recommends for Org Health

Salesforce doesn’t give a single "health score" — but recommends monitoring these **pillars**:
- 🔐 **Security & Access** → # of profiles, permission sets, users with Modify All
- 🧱 **Data Model Hygiene** → custom fields per object, field usage, naming conventions
- 🔄 **Automation Logic** → how many flows, workflow rules, triggers per object
- ⚙️ **Apex Code Quality** → code coverage, recursion, limits, debug logs
- 🎨 **UI Complexity** → page layouts, Lightning components, Visualforce usage
- 📦 **Metadata Volume** → total metadata components, stale assets, bloat

---

### 📊 Proposed Health Score Formula (MetaScope v1)

```
Overall Health Score (0–100) = 
   (Sec + Data + Auto + Apex + UI + Meta) / 6
```

Each of the 6 pillars scores from 0–100 based on:

| Metric | Benchmarks |
|--------|------------|
| 🔐 Security | Users with excessive perms < 5% |
| 🧱 Fields | < 500 unused fields |
| 🔄 Automations | < 3 overlapping per object |
| ⚙️ Apex | > 75% test coverage |
| 🎨 UI | < 10 page layouts per object |
| 📦 Metadata | < 5000 total components |

🖱️ **Click Behavior:** Clicking the "Overall Health" card opens a modal or drawer.

✅ **Contains:**
- 📈 Trend line (last 5 score snapshots)
- 🧱 Bar chart of score by pillar (Security, Data Model, etc.)
- 🧠 “How is this calculated?” with formulas + benchmarks
- 🧰 “Recommended Fixes” – based on low-scoring areas

👉 Optional: “Compare to Industry Benchmarks” toggle

---

### ⚠️ **2. Issues Found — Insight Center View**

🖱️ **Click Behavior:** Clicking `Issues Found` opens a filtered list.

✅ **Contains:**
- 📝 List of issues (e.g., “Field X is unused,” “Flow Y conflicts with Trigger Z”)
- 📊 Issue severity filters (Critical, Warning, Info)
- 🪄 Suggested resolution per issue
- 🧪 Add "Issue ID" for export & traceability

👉 BONUS: Allow "Mark as Resolved" with state tracking

---

### 📦 **3. Metadata Components — Visualization Hub**

🖱️ **Click Behavior:** Clicking `Metadata Components` opens metadata visualizer

✅ **Contains:**
- 📊 Bar chart: # of metadata types (Apex, Flows, Fields, Layouts…)
- 🔁 Pie chart: % custom vs standard components
- 📉 Stale component list (> 6 months unused)
- 📎 Most referenced components list (drillable)
- 🔍 Search & filter by type, last modified, created by

👉 BONUS: Add "Metadata Bloat Indicator" badge

---

## ✅ PHASE 3 – NEXT-LEVEL INTERACTIONS

### 🎯 New Features to Add to Each Drilldown Panel

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔄 Auto-Refresh | Org Health reanalyzes every 12 hours |
| 🔔 Slack Alerts | Send alerts if health drops or new issues hit |
| 📅 Timeline Mode | Track how org evolved over time |
| 📥 Export | PDF/CSV export per drilldown |
| 🧠 AI-Powered Recommendations | "This field hasn’t been used in 180 days. Consider deleting." |

## 🔧 Technical Suggestion: Use ECharts

For all score breakdowns, trends, and comparisons — use ECharts for:
- Radar chart of org health pillars
- Timeline graph (health score over time)
- Donut charts for metadata breakdown

Let me know which one you want scaffolded first (e.g., Overall Health Drilldown UI or Metadata Visualizer).
