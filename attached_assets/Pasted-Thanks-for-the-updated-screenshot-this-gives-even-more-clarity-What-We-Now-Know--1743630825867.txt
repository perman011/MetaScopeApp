Thanks for the updated screenshot — this gives even more clarity.

### 🧠 What We Now Know:

1. 🔥 You are still getting `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'notify')` — so the app is **still trying to trigger a toast/notification** on org load failure or success.
2. 🧭 You're in the `Data Model Analyzer` tab.
3. 🔍 The **object list is not fully populating**, and you're typing in the search field, likely triggering the error right after that.

---

### ✅ What This Suggests (Tech Stack-Aware)

Here’s what’s likely happening based on your stack:

#### **1. The Toast is Still Not Hooked Up Correctly**
- You’re using `toast()` or `notify()` but didn’t register the `Toaster` component globally in `main.tsx`, or
- You're using a `notify` function that isn't imported or defined at all (likely in a `try/catch` or `.catch()` when fetching objects).

> 🎯 Suggestion: **Go to `src/main.tsx` and confirm `<Toaster />` from `@/components/ui/sonner` or `shadcn/ui` is rendered at the root of your app.**

---

#### **2. Object List Query is Failing Silently**

You’re likely using **TanStack React Query** (`useQuery`) to load objects from your backend (`/api/metadata/objects` or similar). If the backend is:

- Not returning data
- Returning an error (e.g., invalid auth, empty array)
- Returning a malformed payload (e.g., not an array)

Then the dropdown/search won’t render correctly.

> 🎯 Suggestion:
> - Go to the file: `src/pages/data-model-analyzer/index.tsx` or wherever the component lives
> - Open the `useQuery()` that loads object metadata
> - Wrap it in a `try/catch` or use `.error` from the query object
> - Log `data`, `error`, and `isLoading` to see what’s really going on

---

#### **3. Frontend Is Crashing Before State Can Update**

You likely have something like:

```ts
if (objects.length > 0) {
  notify("Loaded!");
}
```

But `objects` is undefined or `notify` is undefined — so React crashes before the UI updates.

> 🎯 Suggestion:
> Add guard checks before calling `.length`, `.map()`, or `notify()` — especially on any async load.

### 🔧 Dev Task Prompt (Send to AI Agent)

> ### 🔧 Fix org object list loading + toast crash
>
> In `Data Model Analyzer`:
>
> 1. **Fix toast crash:**  
> Prevent runtime crash: `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'notify')`.  
> - Identify the toast function being used (e.g. `notify`, `toast`)  
> - Ensure `Toaster` from `shadcn/ui` is mounted at app root (`main.tsx`)  
> - Replace or remove `notify()` if undefined
>
> 2. **Fix object list population:**  
> - Ensure the query fetching org metadata objects (`useQuery`) is working correctly  
> - Add logs or fallback UI for cases where the result is `null`, `undefined`, or an error  
> - Populate the dropdown with searchable `Select` component using full org object list

If you want, I can help walk through checking your actual `main.tsx` or `query` structure if you paste or upload those. Want to do that next?
