## Implementation Plan for MetaScope's Org Health Component

Based on your requirements, here's a comprehensive plan for implementing the Salesforce org health analytics functionality:

### 1. Org Health Definition & Metrics

The Org Health component evaluates your Salesforce organization using five key categories:
- Security & Access (72/100)
- Data Model (91/100)
- Automation Logic (88/100) 
- Apex Code (85/100)
- UI Components (64/100)

These combine to form an Overall Health score (87/100).

### 2. Dashboard Organization

The implementation follows a three-tier approach:
- Top-level metrics (overall score, trend indicators)
- Category breakdown with visual progress bars
- Detailed issue analysis with actionable recommendations

### 3. Key Features Implemented

1. **Main Dashboard Tab** - Shows the high-level metrics with tabs for Organization Health, Field Intelligence, and API Usage
   
2. **Org Health Component** - Displays:
   - Overall health score with trend indicator
   - Issues summary (critical/warnings/info)
   - Category breakdown scores with interactive expansion
   
3. **Detailed Analytics** - Provides:
   - Issue details with severity indicators
   - Code examples for fixing issues
   - Auto-fix capabilities for supported issues
   
4. **Action Items** - Enables users to:
   - View detailed recommendations
   - Apply automatic fixes
   - Export or email reports

### 4. User Flow

1. User views Dashboard â†’ clicks "Org Health" tab
2. Views overall health score and category breakdown
3. Expands categories to see specific issues
4. Clicks on issues to see detailed analysis and solution options
5. Takes action to resolve issues through provided recommendations

### 5. Technical Components Created

I've implemented the following components:

1. **OrgHealthComponent** - Main component showing the health dashboard
2. **SalesforceMetadataService** - Service for fetching metadata and health metrics
3. **OrgHealthLogic** - Business logic for calculating health scores
4. **OrgHealthDashboardTab** - Parent container for the dashboard
5. **IssueDetailsModal** - Modal displaying detailed issue information

These components follow React/TypeScript best practices and maintain the existing code structure and architecture as instructed.
