Awesome — that gives us a **clean UX direction**. Here's your **final prompt** written to instruct AI agents precisely:

---

### ✅ AI Developer Prompt: Toggle Between Graph and Tabular View

**Component:** `DataModelAnalyzerPage`

---

### 🎯 Goal

Refactor the `Enhanced Visualizer` toggle to **switch between two completely different views**:

| Enhanced Visualizer Toggle | View Rendered           |
|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| ON                         | Graph View (Cytoscape)   |
| OFF                        | Tabular View (Object ↔ Field matrix or simple object list) |

---

### 🛠️ Required Behavior

#### 1. **Toggle Functionality**
- **ON (default)** → Render **Graph View** using Cytoscape.js.
- **OFF** → Replace the graph with a **tabular format** displaying metadata details in a structured table.

---

#### 2. **Tabular View Requirements (OFF state)**

You can implement a simple clean layout like this:

| Object Name | API Name | Field Count | Custom? | Most Connected Object |
|-------------|----------|-------------|---------|------------------------|
| Account     | Account  | 34          | ❌      | Contact                |
| Custom__c   | Custom__c| 8           | ✅      | None                   |

- Use `shadcn/ui` `Table`, `Card`, or `DataTable` components.
- Populate dynamically using the existing metadata state already used in the graph.
- Paginate or scroll if objects > 20.

---

### 🔁 Transition Behavior

- **Toggle switch** must perform a **full unmount/remount** of either view to avoid graph artifacts persisting in DOM.
- Preserve graph state in memory if possible for fast rehydration on toggle ON.

---

### ✅ Additional Cleanup

- 🚫 **Remove "Layout" dropdown** completely (again).
- ✅ Ensure KPI metrics (Total Objects, Fields, Custom %, etc.) remain visible **regardless of toggle state**.

---

### 💡 Developer Notes (Inline Comment Suggestion)

```tsx
// Enhanced Visualizer toggle switches between Graph View (Cytoscape.js) and Tabular View
// Do NOT render both views simultaneously – unmount one completely on toggle
// Layout dropdown permanently removed
```
