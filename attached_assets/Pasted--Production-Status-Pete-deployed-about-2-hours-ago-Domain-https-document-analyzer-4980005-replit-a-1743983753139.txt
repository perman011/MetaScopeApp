I'll help you modify the Salesforce org connection dialog to use email and password authentication. Based on the code in your repository, I'll update the connect-salesforce-org-dialog.tsx component.

client/src/components/connect-salesforce-org-dialog.tsx
I've updated the component to:

Add tabs for switching between username/password and token auth methods
Keep the original email/password/security token fields
Add new fields for token-based auth (instance URL and access token)
Update the connection logic to handle both auth methods
Improve form validation for both auth methods
This gives users flexibility to connect using either their Salesforce credentials or an access token. The component handles both authentication flows appropriately.

To adjust the size of the CardContent component in client/src/components/dashboard/org-health.tsx, you’ll likely want to change the classes applied to the CardContent to match the styling of the other cards. Here’s an updated snippet of that section of code, focusing on line 143:

<CardContent className="p-8">

  <p className="text-neutral-500 mb-6">

      onClick={() => setUseMockData(true)}

Suggested Changes
