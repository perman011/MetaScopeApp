Perfect ‚Äî here's a clear **technical execution plan** for your AI agent team based on your notes and UI feedback.

## ‚úÖ Part 1: Sidebar Expand/Collapse Toggle ‚Äì Correct Placement & Behavior

### üîç Issue Summary
- Current expand/collapse button is **rendering in the middle of the screen as an invisible square** (see circled area).
- Expected: Button should appear near the edge of the left and right panels (where you marked an ‚ùå).
- It's likely **not positioned correctly using CSS or layout nesting**.

### üß† Execution Plan (Left and Right Sidebar Toggle Fix)

#### Step 1: Audit Current Toggle Code
- Locate the component responsible for sidebar toggle behavior (likely in `DataModelAnalyzer.tsx` or layout wrapper).
- Identify the component rendering the **toggle button**. It may be:
  - Floating `<button>` not anchored to a layout container
  - Rendered without proper position: absolute/fixed

#### Step 2: Reposition the Button
- Ensure the button is rendered **inside each sidebar panel**, not inside the main graph canvas.
- For the left panel, place the button at the **far right edge of the left container**.
- For the right panel, place the button at the **far left edge of the right sidebar**.
- Use Tailwind utilities like `absolute`, `top-1/2`, `-translate-y-1/2`, `right-0`, or `left-0` to align it properly.

#### Step 3: Style the Button
- Use a **minimal icon button** (e.g. `chevron-left`, `chevron-right`) from Lucide or similar icon library.
- Add hover/focus styles and appropriate aria-labels for accessibility.
- Button state should toggle an internal flag: `isSidebarCollapsed` or similar.

#### Step 4: Hook Up Toggle Logic
- When clicked:
  - Collapse the corresponding sidebar (e.g. `setLeftPanelVisible(false)`)
  - Expand it again when toggled back
- Ensure it triggers a **layout refresh** so the graph adjusts to the new canvas size

## ‚úÖ Part 2: Fix Layout When "Enhanced Visualizer" is Off

### üîç Issue Summary
- Turning off Enhanced Visualizer breaks node positioning ‚Äî graph is **clumped or spread out randomly**.
- Expected: Turning toggle off should still respect selected layout (Circular, Grid, etc.)

---

### üß† Execution Plan (Enhanced Visualizer Toggle Layout Fix)

#### Step 1: Identify What the Toggle Does
- Locate logic tied to `EnhancedVisualizer` toggle state.
- Determine whether it:
  - Switches between rendering modes
  - Alters node size/shape/labels
  - Changes which layout engine is used (or disables layout completely)

#### Step 2: Fix Layout Persistence
- Ensure that **disabling Enhanced Visualizer does NOT remove or override the selected layout algorithm**.
- `layout.run()` or equivalent should still be called based on `layoutAlgorithm` state.

#### Step 3: Re-run Layout on Toggle
- Add a listener or effect to detect when EnhancedVisualizer is toggled.
- Re-run the layout algorithm (`cy.layout({...}).run()`) to ensure positioning recalculates correctly.

#### Step 4: Test with All Layout Modes
- Verify correct behavior with all options: Force-Directed, Grid, Circular, etc.
- Nodes should remain spaced and readable regardless of visualizer state

### üéØ Final Goal
- ‚úÖ Clean and usable toggles for both side panels
- ‚úÖ No layout bugs when switching visualizer modes
- ‚úÖ Chart always stays readable and well-positioned
