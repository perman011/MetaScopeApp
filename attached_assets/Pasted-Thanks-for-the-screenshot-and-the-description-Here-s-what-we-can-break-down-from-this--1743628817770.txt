Thanks for the screenshot and the description. Here's what we can break down from this:

---

### ðŸ§¨ **Issue Summary:**
You're encountering a runtime error:
```
[plugin:runtime-error-plugin] Cannot read properties of null (reading 'notify')
```
This usually means **some component is trying to access `.notify` on a variable that is `null` or `undefined`.**

### Likely Cause:
This error seems tied to a **notification or toast utility** that isnâ€™t properly initialized before use.

You mentioned:
> the actual model analyzer is there, functions when I search from search button errors out...

So the issue likely occurs:
- On the **search button click handler**.
- When a **notification or feedback mechanism (like toast)** is triggered but `notify` is not defined.

### âœ… Fix Prompt for Agent AI:

Use this prompt to direct your dev agent clearly:

---

> ðŸ›  **Fix null notify error on Search**
>
> In the **Data Model Analyzer** page (`/data-model-analyzer`), clicking the **search button** triggers a runtime error:
> ```
> Cannot read properties of null (reading 'notify')
> ```
> Likely cause: A `notify` function (toast/snackbar/etc.) is being called on a null/undefined object. 
>
> **Required Fix:**
> 1. Ensure `notify` is initialized before it's called.
> 2. If using a custom toast or library like `react-toastify`, verify the hook/provider is present in the root layout or component tree.
> 3. Add a fallback/log if `notify` is not available.
> 
> ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Searching objects should not throw errors and should return results or a friendly message (e.g. "No results found").

### ðŸ”§ UI Enhancements Prompt:

Also, to improve the dropdown and search interaction:

> âœ¨ **Enhance UI: Dropdown for Layout + Object Select**
>
> On the **Data Model Analyzer** page:
>
> 1. The **"Layout Algorithm"** should be a dropdown menu with options:
>    - Force-Directed (Default)
>    - Circular
>    - Grid
>    - Concentric
>    - Breadthfirst
>
> 2. The **Object selector** should:
>    - Be a searchable dropdown
>    - Load Salesforce object list from org metadata
>    - Allow selection of 1 object at a time
> 
> Libraries like `shadcn/ui` Select or `headlessui` can be used for better accessibility and keyboard support.

Would you like me to write a code snippet using `shadcn/ui`'s `<Select />` with search, wired up to your object list and layout options?
